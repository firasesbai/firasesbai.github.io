Under the Notes section, I will be publishing short summaries along with notes about books that I’m reading.

No one can argue about the advantages of reading books and the importance of incorporating this habit into your daily routine. Whether it is widening your knowledge on various topics, improving your vocabulary, focus and concentration or strengthening your brain, the list of benefits goes on.

However, one question that always comes up: *How can we remember all the books that we read?*

This blog post is the very beginning to the answer that I personally have found very useful to address this issue and hence wanted to share with you.

I’m sure you have already guessed it by now. Yes you’re right, by **Taking Notes!**

Taking notes and highlighting some important sections while reading a book is a great way to help you recall the information in order to be able to apply it later on. What’s even more rewarding is to put it all together in one place that can be used later on as a quick reference to turn to anytime you want to remember some ideas or main points. 

Generally the main structure in the upcoming summaries will have the following sections:

1. Summary
2. Favorite Quotes
3. Main Takeaways

I hope you find this section of the blog insightful whether by finding your next read or to motivate you to start taking notes and remembering more. 

*Stay tuned!*
