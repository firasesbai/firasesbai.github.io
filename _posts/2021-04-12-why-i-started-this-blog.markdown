You might be feeling overwhelmed by the redundancy and abundance of information out there, at least I did, though it is still never too late.  
Feeling reluctant at the beginning, starting this blog turned out to be one of my best decisions.
As least intriguing as it might be, the idea of starting a blog nowadays backed with the right reasons, *YOUR* right reasons, could only bring you joy, fulfillment and benefit you in so many ways. 

That being said, here are mine through which i hope to inspire and motivate you to show and share your work: 

### 1. Inspire and help others ###

   Whether it is part of your domain of expertise, a topic you are interested in, a technical post, a solution to a certain problem you encountered, 
   a summary of a book you just read, or simply an idea or thought that you just felt the need to share, you never know when, where or to whom you might 
   be reaching and affecting. 

### 2. Improve your writing and thinking skills ###

   It goes without saying that writing more often will improve your writing skills just like any other competence that gets better through practice. 
   Not to mention learning to better organize and express your thoughts and ideas in a concise way in order to reach more audience.      


### 3. Deepen your knowledge ###

   It doesnâ€™t matter if you are an expert on the subject or not, writing good posts requires further research and investigation beforehand. 
   Through this repetitive effort to write informative articles you are not only profiting others but yourself as well.  

### 4. Expand your network ###

   Whether it is through comments, emails or social media you will be able to interact and make the acquaintance of other people. 
   This could turn out to be the very beginning of a long term business or personal relationship. 

### 5. Build up your profile ###

   Having an online presence and contributing to the community is appreciated in many areas and could be the reason behind an impactful future opportunity. 

I hope you enjoy the content on my blog and to find it helpful no matter how small it might be. I'm eager to hear about your stories and motivations. Feel free to drop your reasons in the comments below. 

*One final thought to mention is that my posts are my own and do not reflect the opinions of my current, past or future employers.*
