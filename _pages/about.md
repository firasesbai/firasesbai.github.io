         I started this site as a place to keep my own writings and document my learning journey. <br/>
         What started as an experiment has now grown into an informal writing habit that I’m sharing with you.

      The articles I publish cover a broad range of big data and artificial intelligence related topics. <br/>
      My main interest is building intelligent data intensive systems focusing on design and architecture challenges to help businesses thrive with better data-driven decisions. <br/>
      I also occasionally publish notes on books that I find interesting and give reading recommendations on a variety of subjects and areas.
