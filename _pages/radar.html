        <h3>What is the Data Engineering Tech Radar?</h3>
        <p>
            This radar is a curated, opinionated guide to the landscape of data tools, platforms, and concepts.
            It's a living document that reflects my experience and perspective on the data engineering ecosystem, inspired by the original ThoughtWorks Tech Radar and built using the Zalando Radar visualization library.
        </p>
        <h4>Quadrants</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Languages & Frameworks</strong>: This quadrant covers the foundational skills, languages and frameworks.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformation & Orchestration</strong>: Tools and practices for data transformation, ETL processes, and workflow orchestration.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Platforms & Storage</strong>: Technologies for data storage, databases, and data warehousing solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analytics</strong>: Tools and platforms for data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
        <h4>Rings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ADOPT</strong>: Technologies that are well-established and I have used or seen other teams adopt them in production and they've proven their value.</li>
            <li><strong>TRIAL</strong>: Emerging technologies that show promise and I have started exploring them or using on non-critical projects.</li>
            <li><strong>ASSESS</strong>: Technologies that caught my eye and are used or recommended by other teams that I think are worth exploring.</li>
            <li><strong>HOLD</strong>: Technologies to proceed with caution on and I would not recommended for new projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this radar is to provide a structured way to navigate the complex and rapidly evolving landscape of data engineering technologies.
            It serves as a personal knowledge base to track the adoption and development of tools, showcase hands-on experience, and offer an opinionated perspective on the state of data engineering.
            The radar is not exhaustive but aims to spark conversations and help others make informed decisions about the technologies they choose.
