Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. 

You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on referenced above at the following [link](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).
